Have you ever heard about Deoksu-Gung? Deoksu-Gung is not a famous place for foreign travelers but for 한국인.

# 2. What is Deoksu-Gung ?

Deoksugung, also known as Gyeongun-gung, Deoksugung Palace, or Deoksu Palace, is a walled compound of palaces in Seoul that was inhabited by members of Korea's royal family during the Joseon monarchy until the annexation of Korea by Japan in 1910. It is one of the "Five Grand Palaces" built by the kings of the Joseon Dynasty[1] and designated as a Historic Site.
Why is it so famous?

# 3. History
![덕수궁 역사](/img/posts/04/덕수궁역사.jfif)
Deoksugung was originally the residence of Grand Prince Wolsan, the older brother of King Seongjong. This residence became a royal 'palace' during the Imjin war after all of the other palaces were burned in 1592 during the Imjin wars. King Seonjo was the first Joseon king to reside at the palace. King Gwanghaegun was crowned in this palace in 1608, and renamed it Gyeongun-gung (경운궁, 慶運宮) in 1611. After the official palace was moved to the rebuilt Changdeokgung in 1618, it was mostly used as an auxiliary palace was renamed Seogung (West Palace). During its history, it alternated between being a royal residential palace and a temporary residence

# 4. Why is it so famous? (Deoksugung Stonewall path)

In autumn, when the leaves turns red, Deoksugung Stonewall Path looks very beautiful and makes you feel the beauty of autumn. It is such a wonderful stone wall road, but there is also a sad legend(?)that couples break up if they walk through this path. In fact, the origins of this legend(?) is not clear. However, the most likely theory is that there is a Family court beyond this path and couples go to the court to get divorced passing though this path.

In addition to this, this path became more popular with the song of which the title is“광화문 연가 by 이문세”

If you have a chance to visit to Seoul, I sincerely recommend you visit this place.

all things have changed without a trace
all things do, with the passage of time
yet the walkway is still there, stonewall road of deoksugung
there are lovers who are walking hand in hand

someday we'll die and leave this world
people do with the passage of time
you still find at the foot, of the nearby jeongdong-gil
there's a chapel with a blanket of snow

i yearn for the smell of may flowers
stirs up longings deep in my heart
here at the crossroads of the snow clad gwanghwamun
I come back to see it just like this

someday we'll die and leave this world
people do with the passage of time
you still find at the foot, of the nearby jeongdong-gil
there's a chapel with a blanket of snow

i yearn for the smell of may flowers
stirs up longings deep in my heart
here at the crossroads of the snow clad gwanghwamun
I come back to see it just like this

someday we'll die and leave this world
people do with the passage of time
you still find at the foot, of the nearby jeongdong-gil
there's a chapel with a blanket of snow
