# 1. Landmark
What do you think Landmark is? tall buildings? The state of Liberty? The great wall?
What is the landmark in Seoul? Gwanghwa-moon? Lotte World Tower? I suppose it is N-Seoul tower (formerly known as Namsan Tower). You have probably ever seen N-tower if you are interested in Korea.
You can take a look at the view of Seoul which is really beautiful. N-tower is located in the center of Seoul and quite close to downtown, so it is easy to visit. For this reason, N-tower became one of the popular tourist attractions in Korea for foreign tourists as well as Soul citizens

<br>(Bahasa: Anda sudah pernah dengar N-tower? Menurut saya, N-tower itu landmark di Seoul seperti Monas di Jakarta. Karna itu salah satu tempat beristirat untuk penduduk di Seoul)

<br>(汉语：您觉得landmark是什么？ 我认为N-Seoul Tower 是首尔的Landmark。您可能已经在电视看N-tower，如果你您喜欢韩国.首尔没有高高大大的建筑,不过还是有吸引力的城市)

# 2. History
N-tower was built in 1971. The tower was not built for tourist attraction but for broadcasting tower. It is first general radio wave tower providing TV and radio broadcasting in Seoul. Currently, the tower broadcasts signals for Korean media outlets, such as KBS, MBC and SBS. The tower had been renovated in 2005 and turned into N-tower.

How to get to N-tower / transportation
There are several ways to get to N-tower.
a.	Bus : You can take a bus (02, 04) you can also use a shuttle bus. These buses can be arranged to pick you up from a specific location nearby.
b.	Cablecar : You can also go up to the mountain by cablecar. Once you’ve reached Namsan Cable Car Center, you can purchase your ticket in the booth
c.	Walk : I highly recommend that you walk to N-tower. You can take a walk around Namdaemoon , Seoul statin and Myungdong because those places are nearby.  Although it takes about 30-45 minutes and is quite steep, I can guarantee you it must be an enjoyable walk.

The N Seoul Tower is divided into three main sections, including the N Lobby, N Plaza, and the N Tower. The N Plaza consists of two floors, while the N Tower consists of four floors.
N-tower consists of 8 floors. P stands for Plaza which includes Ticket booth, Food Court, Light Garden, Grass Terrace, Souvenir Shop, Characters & Photos. T stands for Tower which includes Observatory and restaurants. The N Tower has four floors: 1F, 2F, 3F, and 5F (most buildings in Korea avoid having fourth floors).
Tower
The tower is renowned as a national landmark and for its cityscape views. It is great place for dating as well as taking hiking. The tower and mountaintop both have amazing views
Love Padlocks
The "Locks of Love" is a popular location for people to hang locks that symbolize eternal love.
Many couples flock to Namsan Tower to make their love ‘locked’.

Namsan is an attraction that is famous for a good reason.
Lotte Tower is amazing, but it is too high to judge the true scale of the city and the buildings below you. Namsan Tower, on the other hand, is more central to Seoul and gives you an amazing view nearly all of the city.

# 4. My words
Every time I came back to Seoul, I went to N-Tower and Han-river to contemplate my future and save the landscape of Seoul in my eyes before leaving Korea. N-tower is the best place for Citizen in Seoul.
In fact, Seoul is as busy and crowded as other megacities are. Scenery in drama or film is wonderful but bunch of people get tired of living, are exhausted by their work. Every now and then some of my friends ask me that “they never smile at each other. It seems that they get angry. What makes them angry? “ well..  You could see subway or bus passengers watching their cellphone all the time. You can possibly regard them as unfriendly or hostile people but I’d say that "they are just little bit shy".
There is no massive building or construction such as the Great wall or the Eiffel Tower in Seoul. However, Seoul is still attractive. Citizens’ lives and culture give you an unforgettable experience.

<br>(Bahasa : Setiap kali saya Kembali ke Seoul, saya kunjungi sungai Han atau N-tower. Dua tempat itu sangat cocok untuk mengaturkan pikiran. Teman-teman saya pernah bertanya pada saya : kenapa orang Korea tidak bersenyum, tidak berbicara? Apakah mereka marah? Mereka tak marah atau galak tapi hanya malu pada orang lain. Sebenarnya Seoul bukan kota wisata tapi kota industry. Tidak ada Gedung mewah atau pemandangan yang indah tapi kehidupan dan kebudayaan penduduk Seoul itu cukup menarik. Jika anda datang ke Seoul, coba kunjungi N-tower!)

<br>(汉语: 每次我回来韩国，我去南山N-tower还是汉江。因为两个地方很合适清理思想。虽然首尔不是旅游城市但是却是很有意思得趣的城市。N-tower又离明洞, 南大門 很近又风景真的很美.我想 推荐N-tower如果你们来首尔。你们能带去忘不了的回忆.）
