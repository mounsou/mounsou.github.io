# 1. What is Deoksu-gung?
Deaksu-gung is one of the palaces in Seoul that was inhabited by members of Korea's royal family during the Joseon monarchy until the annexation of Korea by Japan in 1910.
Deoksugung Palace is special among Korean palaces. It has a modern and a western style garden and fountain. The Changing of the Royal Guard, in front of Daehanmun (Gate), is a very popular event for many visitors. The royal guard was responsible for opening and closing the palace gate during the Joseon Dynasty.

# 2. History
There are several palaces in Seoul but the other palaces does not have urban myth except Deoksu-gung. The Deoksu-gung Stonewall walkway is at the heart of a popular urban myth in Seoul, as it is said that all couples who walk down this road are fated to break-up.

In fact, there is no definite origin. but the most plausible story is that the Seoul Family Court appears going through the Deoksugung Stonewall walkway, which means lovers pass by the way to get a divorce.
<br>
What makes Deoksugung more popular is the song - A Love Song (Gwanghwamun Sonata) which brings back old memories.
<br>
Deoksugung is so gorgeous when the leaves trun red . For this reason, it is more crowded in autumn than in other seasons. It is not a historical tourist destination, but a place to reminisce and enjoy autumn.
<br>
In Korean, there is an expression “I got sentimental in the fall”, which means I feel quite distracted. It has been a long time since I felt “sentimental in the fall” I sincerely recommend that you visit this place whether with your lover or alone.
